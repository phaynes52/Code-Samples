<p>Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only, to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a lecture. However, others can still contribute to this repository -- to do so, take the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a github account, if you do not have one</li>
<li>Fork this repository: you can click on the &quot;Fork&quot; link in the upper right, or just click <a href="https://github.com/markfloryan/dsa2/fork">here</a></li>
<li>Clone your forked repository on to your local machine</li>
<li>Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and push your changes back to your forked repository</li>
<li>Create a pull request, following the instructions <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">here</a></li>
</ol>
<p>At that point, I will receive a notice that a change has been submitted, and I'll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main repository.</p>
<p>When you want to bring in the updates from the main dsa1 github repository into your forked repository, you will need to follow the instructions <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>Builds upon previous analysis of algorithms and the effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such as searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include applications of heaps, trees, and hash tables as well as an introduction to new structures such as graphs and sets. Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions between problems.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a> course objectives are below. Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and implement more advanced data structures, including (but not limited to) graphs and sets (e.g., find-union). Students will be able to analyze the asymptotic complexity of the operations of these structures and use them to solve problems.</li>
<li>Understand a variety of problem solving paradigms such as dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, and greedy algorithms. Students will be able to implement a variety of algorithms, including Breadth-First (and Depth-First) Search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Ford-Fulkerson, and others.</li>
<li>Analyze a new problem and select an appropriate problem-solving technique. Students will be able to construct an algorithm to solve the problem, prove the correctness of their algorithm, and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm.</li>
<li>Analyze behavior of algorithms with recursive, and other more advanced properties. Solve recurrence relations for their closed form either manually or via the Master Theorem. Prove both upper and lower bounds on the behavior of such algorithms.</li>
