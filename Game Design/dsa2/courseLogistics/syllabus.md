## Fall 2020

### Instructors ###

- [Mark Floryan](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~mrf8t) / [mrf8t@virginia.edu](mailto:mrf8t@virginia.edu).  Office: Rice Hall, room 203.  Office hours are TBD

### Course Info ###

- Lecture: M/W/F 12:00-12:50, Thornton Hall E303
- TAs and their office hours will be posted on the course Google Calendar (which is linked to via Collab); all office hours start the Sunday after classes start

**Course Description:** Builds upon previous analysis of algorithms and the effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such as searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include applications of heaps, trees, and hash tables as well as an introduction to new structures such as graphs and sets. Analysis techniques include asymptotic worst case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions between problems. 

**Availability:** It is important to me to be available to my students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with me during office hours, e-mail and I will try to find the time to meet. That being said, like everybody else I am quite busy, so it may take a day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the course - what is working, what is not working, what can be done better, etc. - I am very interested in hearing about them. You can send me an e-mail (please do NOT email the TAs directly). I tend to get bogged down by e-mail as the semester progresses, so seeing me in person (right after lecture, during office hours, etc.) is often a good way to get a more immediate response.

**Prerequisites:** DSA1 and COA1 with a grade of C- or above. You also must have completed Discrete Math with a grade of C- or above.

**Course objectives:** The course objectives are:

- Understand and implement more advanced data structures, including (but not limited to) graphs and sets (e.g., find-union). Students will be able to analyze the asymptotic complexity of the operations of these structures and use them to solve problems.
- Understand a variety of problem solving paradigms such as dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, and greedy algorithms. Students will be able to implement a variety of algorithms, including Breadth-First (and Depth-First) Search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Ford-Fulkerson, and others.
- Analyze a new problem and select an appropriate problem-solving technique. Students will be able to construct an algorithm to solve the problem, prove the correctness of their algorithm, and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm.
- Analyze behavior of algorithms with recursive, and other more advanced properties. Solve recurrence relations for their closed form either manually or via the Master Theorem. Prove both upper and lower bounds on the behavior of such algorithms.

**Grades:** Grades are calculated using a **module** system. The course has 14 modules. Each module has three completion levels: Incomplete, Competency, and Mastery. Each letter grade is associated with competence and mastery in some subset of the 14 modules. A summary of the specific grade mappings can be found on the [course grading page](./grading.html)

**Special Circumstances:** Students with special circumstances (athletics, extra time required on exams, final exam conflicts, SDAC considerations, etc.) need to let me know during the **first week of class**.

**Textbooks:** There is no required textbook, however Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen et. al. is highly recommended as a resource for this course.

**Homeworks:** Each of the modules in the course contains at least one homework assignment. To master a module, you must complete all of the homework assignments associated with that module (and pass the quiz (see below). Homeworks are pass/fail. A grader will either assess that the work is sufficient, or is not sufficient. If the latter, you may fix the errors and resubmit. All homeworks must be completed before the last Wednesday class period (i.e., the second to last lecture for the semester).

All assignments will be submitted through Collab under the assignments tool.

**Quizzes:** Each module contains an associated quiz. Every other Friday in lecture, you will be given a quiz booklet (one page per module) with a set of quizzes. You may take up to two of the quizzes in the booklet during each session. The quizzes are pass/fail. In order to obtain competency or mastery in a module, you MUST complete the quiz succesfully for that module.

**Exams:** There will be three exams (two midterms and one final exam). These exams are each an opportunity to increase your final grade by one half letter grade. See the course grade summary page for more details. You must earn at least an 80% grade on each midterm to earn the increased letter grade.

**Final Exam:** Our final exam will be a 2-hour (note the shortened time span). The final exam will be seperated into two halves and each half is pass/fail (80 percent is passing threshold). Each half, if passed, adds one half letter grade to your final grade.

**Computing resources:** There are two specific computer resources needed for this course:

- You need to have a working computer that can run Java, Python, or C++. Any modern laptop or desktop will have no problem running these programming languages.

**Attendance:** Attendance in lecture is not required but is highly recommended.

**Recording Lectures:** You may NOT record my lectures. University policy states that this is not allowed without my consent. I will be recording my lectures for you and the recordings will automatically upload to the course Collab site.

**Professionalism:** We are all adults, and should act like such.  Acting in an unprofessional manner that disrupts the class will first incur a stern talking-to.  After that, a grade penalty may be assessed.  Examples include: disrupting class, trolling people on Piazza, etc.  This is meant to keep people from repeatedly disrupting class; we aren't trying to be super strict on this.  And yes, a warning will first be given prior to any other action.

**Honor Policy:** There have been a large number of honor violations in this class and other low-level CS courses recently.  Outside the normal UVa honor policy rules, we have these additional rules:

1. If you are looking at another student's source code for ANY reason (including code from a student from a previous semester), you are in violation of the honor policy.
2. There are multiple midterm periods where students take exams, with a break between the the individual section times.  Discussing the exam with a student who has not taken it is a violation of the honor policy.
4. Releasing your homework online, including a public github repository, is an honor violation

Any honor violation or cheating will be referred to the honor committee, **and will result in an immediate failure for the course**, regardless of the outcome of the honor trial or your other grades.  No exceptions!  I am very strict on this, and one have successfully raised honor charges against students in the past due to violations of this policy.
