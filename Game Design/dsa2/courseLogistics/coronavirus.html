<p><a href="index.html">Main Logistics Page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<h2 id="online-courses"><a name="introduction"></a>Online Courses</h2>
<p>As you all probably know, the University is transitioning to <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/coronavirus/faq#students">online courses</a> for the foreseeable future. As we navigate this challenging time, we will do our best to continue learning as best we can. This page provides information on how the course will proceed beginning Thursday, March 19.</p>
<h2 id="lectures"><a name="introduction"></a>Lectures</h2>
<p>Course lectures will be recorded ahead of time, and posted on Collab under the &quot;Lecture Capture&quot; tool. This is the same place lecture recordings have always been placed. The lectures will be posted <strong>before the date of lecture</strong>. The expectation is that you will watch the recorded lecture during our normal class period (MWF 12-12:50). Because of the lack of interaction, I expect that the lecture recordings will be shorter than the full 50 minutes (probably 30-40 minutes each on average).</p>
<p><strong>Why aren't we using Zoom (or similar) for lectures?</strong> I strongly considered this, but I'm concerned with technological problems disrupting the delivery of course material. For this reason, I'd like to produce &quot;clean&quot; lecture videos to deliver the material and we will use more interactive methods for Office Hours and other aspects of the course (see below).</p>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a name="introduction"></a>Office Hours</h2>
<p>Office hours will be held using <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. There is a link on our Collab page (the link is called <strong>Online Meetings</strong>). Floryan and the TAs will post a meeting room inside this tool for each individual OH session. By simply clicking on the link, you can access the meeting room, ask questions, get help, etc.</p>
<p>I will be changing my office hours a bit. Check the <a href="index.html">main course logistics page</a> for details. It appears that I am holding fewer OH but they are dedicated to dsa2 students only. Overall, I'm holding more OH than before if you include the ones for my other class.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks"><a name="introduction"></a>Homeworks</h2>
<p>Homework assignments remain unchanged. We already have flexible deadlines. You should continue to submit your assignments on Gradescope as usual.</p>
<h2 id="quizzes"><a name="introduction"></a>Quizzes</h2>
<p>Quizzes are temporarily suspended. I considered making quizzes take-home. However, the purpose of quizzes is to ask you questions in a proctored setting. Because this is not easily possible right now, we will suspend all quizzes and re-assess the grading scheme for the course depending on how many quiz session were missed.</p>
<p>As of right now, quizzes are removed as a requirement for achieving letter grades. See the <a href="grading.html">grading page</a> for details on these changes. If the University allows us to begin meeting face-to-face again, we will reinstitute quizzes but decrease the quiz requirements depending on the number of quiz sessions we have missed.</p>
<h2 id="exams"><a name="introduction"></a>Exams</h2>
<p>Midterm 2 and the Final Exam are not scheduled until the end of April. Thus, I am not yet making a decision on how exams will work. It is my intention to still hold exams. If courses are still online, they will be take-home, but the format of the exam may change. The dates of these exams remain unchanged and their effect on your grade remains unchanged as well.</p>
