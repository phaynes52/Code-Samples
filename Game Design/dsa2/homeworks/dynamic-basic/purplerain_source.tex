\problemname{Purple Rain}

\illustration{0.2}{purplerain/problem_statement/purplerain.png}

Purple rain falls in the magic kingdom of Linearland which is a
straight, thin peninsula.

On close observation however, Prof. Nelson Rogers finds that actually
it is a mix of Red and Blue drops.

In his zeal, he records the location and color of the raindrops in
different locations along the peninsula.
Looking at the data, Professor Rogers wants to know which part of
Linearland had the ``least'' purple rain.

After some thought, he decides to model this problem as follows.
Divide the peninsula into $n$ sections and number them West to East
from $1$ to $n$.  Then, describe the raindrops as a sequence of {\tt
R} and {\tt B}, depending on whether the rainfall in each section is
primarily red or blue.  Finally, find a subsequence of where the
difference between the number of {\tt R} and the number of {\tt B} is
maximized.



\section*{Input}

The input consists of a single line containing a string of $n$
characters ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), describing the color of the raindrops
in sections $1$ to $n$.

It is guaranteed that the string consists of uppercase ASCII letters
`{\tt R}' and `{\tt B}' only.


\section*{Output}

Print, on a single line, two space-separated integers that describe
the starting and ending positions of the part of Linearland that had
the least purple rain.

If there are multiple possible answers, print the one that has the
Westernmost (smallest-numbered) starting section.  If there are multiple
answers with the same Westernmost starting section, print the one with
the Westernmost ending section.
